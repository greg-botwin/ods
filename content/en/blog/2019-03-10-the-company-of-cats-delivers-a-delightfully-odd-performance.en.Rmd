Cats, whose touring company recently opened up at the Pantages Theatre the 27th of February, is a visually entertaining and acoustically rich performance of the now 37 year old broadway classic. The two hour and twenty minute show, which feels just as long due to the repetitive introduction of an innumerable number of cats, is largely driven by the stunningly choreographed dancing of the professional company. 

In a show with few lead star moments, the high points quite literally shine due to the brilliant lighting display the audience is treated to. Although the entire show takes place in-front of a single moon-lit set, the diversity of lighting arrangements continues to make the backdrop look anew throughout the performance. Acoustically, Musical Director Eric Kang’s orchestra delivers a loud and full performance of Andrew Loyd Weber’s Tony Award winner, and the consistently solid singing moves the show along. When the end of the first act finally does come, Keri Rene Fuller (playing Grizabella) delivers a noteworthy rendition of the trademark song Memory, and certainly left me wishing she had a more present role. 

The second act continues much like the first and the choreography of the cast is equally impressive. Lighting Director Natasha Katz holds nothing back in making the case for the Magical Mister Mistoffelees to ascend to the pinnacle position of the Jellicle cat gang, and the accompanying light show Ms. Katz delivers even exceeds Mister Mistoffelees splendid name. In the end, the predictable ending comes true, and the audience is entertained by a cast admirabby and successfully trying to engage with them up-to and beyond the final bow. The ageless show benefits from a truly bizarre and timeless plot, and will continue to delight, confuse, and entertain audiences for decades to come.
