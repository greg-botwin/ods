## Notes

This is the repoistory for my personal webstie
www.opinionsdataandscience.com.

The website is based on the
[Introduction](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-introduction/) theme
(Â© 2018 Victoria Lai) developed for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) by [open
source contributors](https://victoria.dev/).

The website is currently hosted for free by
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and updates deploy automatically
through continuous integration.

The website was built using the R
[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/) package.
